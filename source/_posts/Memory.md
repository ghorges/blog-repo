## Memory

<audio src="/song/Cats-The-Musical-Memory.mp3"  autoplay="autoplay"> </audio>

midnight

not a sound from the pavement

has the moon lost her memory

she is smiling alone

in the lamplight

the withered leaves collect at my feet

and the wind begins to moan

memory

all alone in the moonlight

i can smile at the old days

i was beautiful then

i remember

the time i knew what happiness was

let the memory live again

every street lamp

seems to beat

a fatalistic warning

someone mutters

and a street lamp gutters

and soon it will be morning

daylight

i must wait for the sunrise

i must think of a new life

and i mustn't give in

when the dawn comes

tonight will bo a memory too

and a new day will begin

burnt out ends of smoky days

the stale cold smell of morning

the street lamp dies

another night is over

another day is dawning

touch me

is's so easy to leave to me

all alone with my memory

of my days in the sun

if you touch me

you'll understand what happiness is

look a new day has begun



久听不厌，可惜 memory 已经不再进行演出了，只能在网站上看到之前表演的 memory 了，或许这也是一种 memory 吧。

立个 flag：一定要看一场现场版的 《The Phantom Of the Opera》。
